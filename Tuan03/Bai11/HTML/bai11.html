        <p>Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important
            holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however,
            Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning
            marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day
            of the last Lunar month is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year
            on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On
            New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the
            first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well
            chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien). After
            that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends, and colleagues,
            wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health, and success.

            2. Write about your hobby
            Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby
            of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer,
            swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in
            the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am
            taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time.
            My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any
            sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I
            love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying
            whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a
            goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better
            after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a
            part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.
